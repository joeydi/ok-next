MeetingsIn, e.g. Meetings in London, Meetings in Barcelona.

This client had a powerful event booking search platform, along with a large database of travel-related content. We provided them with a fresh look, which unified their branding, editorial content and search application. Project deliverables included design comps for a variety of potential page layouts, as well as front-end code that was integrated with their proprietary platform by an in-house team.
