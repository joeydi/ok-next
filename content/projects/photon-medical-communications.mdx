Photon Medical develops mobile apps that help health care facilities securely communicate in real-time with physicians. The site I designed and built for them, illustrates the high tech nature of their products, as well as the benefits they provide to health care facilities, physicians, and ultimately patients.

I used vibrant photography and illustrations paired with an airy layout and clean typography to lend a modern feel to their brand. Subtle illustrations throughout the site add visual interest and draw the user through the site.
