This project involved design and development of a custom WordPress theme for a company that delivers driver training to organizations with large fleets of vehicles. The audience for the site is fleet managers, financial officers, and environmental responsibility officers.

The goal with the design is to convey that “Ecodriving” makes economical sense, by saving money in fuels cost, while at the same time providing additional ecological and social benefits.
