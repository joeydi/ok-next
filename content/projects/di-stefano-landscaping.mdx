We've all heard the saying many times before: "Family and business don't mix." But having grown up working on my parents tree farm and nursery, and waiting tables at the family-owned italian restaurant, being involved in the family business has always just been a fact of life. So when my brother's landscaping company was expanding and needed a marketing presence which would reflect the high-quality work they were producing, I jumped at the opportunity.

The website we created is built on the WordPress platform, with a fully-custom responsive theme. We combined tasteful typography, beautiful photos, and animation to create an immersive experience that highlights the award-winning landscape design and maintenance work.
