Expect More Arizona is a movement to ensure a world-class education system for all students. They raise public awareness, mobilizing Arizonans to support the building blocks of education.

The Expect More Excellence Tour is EMAâ€™s campaign to celebrate examples of world-class education already happening in their state. Together we built a platform to showcase user-generated content, which has garnered hundreds of unique, inspiring stories from Arizona citizens. Users are encouraged to view, vote, and share their favorite stories.

The Excellence Tour was built as a microsite within an existing WordPress install. The embedded WordPress theme leverages the YouTube API for saving and sharing videos, the Google Maps API for story discovery and location-based search, and also integrates with the ExactTarget CRM.
