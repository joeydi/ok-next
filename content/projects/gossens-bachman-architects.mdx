This is the third iteration of the GBA website to be designed and built by Okay Plus. The site has evolved from a table-based, Dreamweaver-built relic of its era, to a fast and modern web presence suitable of representing this award-winning architecture firm in Central Vermont.

The site is designed to showcase the wonderful photography of [Jim Westphalen](https://jimwestphalenfineart.com/), Gary Hall, and others, while providing the user with an intuitive interface for exploring their vast body of work.
