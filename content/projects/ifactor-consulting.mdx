iFactor Consulting is a technology company developing products for the country’s largest utilities. Their products use the power of the Smart Grid to put information in the hand’s of the utilities’ customers. Park&Co was contracted to redevelop their brand and bring their website up-to-date.

After the new branding was complete, my role was to develop the look for the new website. I created a variety of designs that highlighted the high-tech nature of their business, as well how their products integrate into the lives of their end users.
