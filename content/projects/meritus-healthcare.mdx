Air Integrated approached me looking for someone to design and develop a series of landing pages for Meritus Healthcare. I provided them with a flexible system which allows them to customize imagery and messaging to target specific audiences. Each of the fully responsive templates targets customers in a specific step of the sales funnel, and includes a clear call-to-action to draw the user to the next step.
