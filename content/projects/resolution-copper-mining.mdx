This is a website we launched for a copper mine in Superior, AZ. The Sustainable Development Report is an annual report highlighting their achievements in a variety of areas such as environment, community, etc.

The client wanted to do something different this year, and our solution is a pretty large departure from the style and tone they typically employ. We added interactivity wherever possible, and also produced videos for the welcome page and the environment section.

For me, the highlights of the site are the animated “sustainability wheel” on the homepage, as well as the Safety section graphic. Both were developed using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Raphael.js](https://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/).
