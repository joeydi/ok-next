<p>This house, designed by <a href="http://www.naf-aad.com/">Naf Architect &amp; Design</a>, is composed of two separate volumes. The individual structures share a roofline, but are divided by a void which serves as a courtyard.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catch a movie at night, for example, a visitor can put me up, the house brought back to work, and the other one home and one away if you can behave quite freely. Future, also lead to the grandparents to live together, even to prepare the room for the children at puberty, which may be better off just enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the poor translation, the concept is to have two spaces which feel like part of one home, but provide the separation necessary for a variety of living situations.</p>
