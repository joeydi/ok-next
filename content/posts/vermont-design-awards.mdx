<p>Last night <a href="http://vermont.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA VT</a> hosted the first annual Vermont Design Awards at the Karma Bird Gallery in Burlington. This curated design exhibition kicked off the first ever <a href="http://designweekvt.com/" target="_blank">Vermont Design Week</a>, which includes lectures, studio tours, designer-led panels, and community events.</p>

<p>There were over 200 submissions to the Design Awards in categories such as Video, Websites, and Publication Design. The judges whittled down the entries to a selection of 50 pieces which are on display throughout the week.</p>

<p>Our work for <a title="Medical Communications Website Design" href="https://okaypl.us/work/photon-medical-communications/">Photon Medical Communications</a> was selected to be put on display, alongside great work from many other talented Vermont designers, such as <a href="http://www.davebarrondesign.com/" target="_blank">Dave Barron Design</a>, <a href="http://wearehmc.com/" target="_blank">HMC Advertising</a>, <a title="James Kowalski" href="http://dubko.com/" target="_blank">Dubko</a>, <a href="http://www.designpartner.com/" target="_blank">DesignPartner</a>, and many more.</p>
