<p>Yeah, I know this is pretty old, but I thought <a href="http://impulsivehighlighters.blogspot.com/#115574735944622140" title="Leopard Preview Screenshots">this was a pretty thorough compilation.</a> Two simple changes stick out for me: when renaming a file, the extension is not selected (<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5933/3208/1600/3.%20Renaming%20Finder%20Items.0.png">duh.</a>) and when changing an extension you can <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5933/3208/1600/5.%20One%20New%20Finder%20Preference.png">opt out</a> of the friendly reminder that it may change the file&#8217;s behavior.</p>
