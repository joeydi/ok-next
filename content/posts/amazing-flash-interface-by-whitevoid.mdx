<p>When you immerse yourself if the world of HTML, CSS, PHP, etc., its easy to forget that there is another half of the universe that deals almost exclusively with Flash. Web standards and accessibility advocates argue that Flash sites are not good &#8220;web citizens&#8221;, due to the proprietary nature of the software used to create and view them, their inability to be indexed by search engines, and their dodgy, often non-existent support for assistive devices, such as screen readers.</p>

<p>In an article at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/semanticflash">A List Apart</a>, Dan Mall wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a belief within the web standards community that Flash is part of a different world. While all approaches have limitations and drawbacks, Flash has been scorned to the point that many refuse to acknowledge its benefits. Ultimately, this has led to the creation of a virtual separation among web designers; those who use Flash use it exclusively (leading to a saturation of full-screen, “Skip Intro”-rich Flash sites on the web) and those who don’t ever give it a second thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this to be true, and while I used to enjoy working with Flash, I have to admit that I&#8217;ve fallen into the latter category recently.</p>

<p>That is, until this evening, when I viewed the WHITEvoid website. The interface is really intuitive, responsive, and fun to use. Environments like this simply can&#8217;t be created with traditional web technologies.</p>

<p>You really should <a href="http://whitevoid.com/application.html">go have a look yourself.</a> For those who care, the site is using <a href="http://blog.papervision3d.org/">Papervision3D</a>, which is an open source 3D engine for Flash.</p>
