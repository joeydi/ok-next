<p>David Pogue just wrote <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/a-home-that-heats-and-cools-itself/">an article about the Enertia House</a>, a house which regulates its climate throughout the year, by creating its own atmosphere. Very cool concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sunspace is always on the south, or the side thatâ€™s within 35 degrees of south. It connects to the attic, which connects to the space between the double north walls, which connects to the basement. There are metal grilles in the sunspace floor to complete the convection loop.</p>
