<p>NetNewsWire, which seems to be the &#8220;best in breed&#8221; RSS feed reader for the Mac, is now a free download. I actually use <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a>, but have only heard great things about NetNewsWire, and its developer, <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3461&quot;">Brent Simmons.</a></p>

<p>If you are not using RSS feeds yet, I highly suggest it, and if you don&#8217;t know what RSS feeds are, then <a href="http://www.whatisrss.com/">you should read this.</a></p>

<p>I will be giving NetNewsWire a try now that is free, to see how it stands up to NewsFire. I will post an update regarding my findings here.</p>
