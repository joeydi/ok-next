<p>Interesting proposal for raised bikeways from architect Martin Angelov.  The system uses tracks to guide the wheels and steel wires that attach to handlebars and provide a safety mechanism.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to safely cruise over busy intersections without having to wait for traffic lights.  I think a system like this could be a great way to promote bike commuting, rewarding those who don&#8217;t drive with a faster route through the city.</p>
