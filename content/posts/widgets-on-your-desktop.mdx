<p><a href="http://www.askdavetaylor.com/dashboard_widgets_on_my_mac_os_x_desktop.html">Ask Dave Taylor</a> has a very simple technique for getting your widgets out of Dashboard and onto your desktop. This is a cool little trick, but not terribly useful as the widgets float on top of all your windows. If they behaved like other windows, or just sat directly on the desktop, I would get much more use out of them.</p>

<p>Regardless, I think my <a href="http://log-a-rhythm.com/blog/../images/calculator.jpg">little orange calculator</a> has found a new home.</p>
