<p><a href="http://flyjs.com/buildings/" title="A JavaScript library for visualizing 3D OSM building data on interactive maps">OSM Buildings</a> is a lightweight Javascript library that adds a 3D Open Street Map data visualization layer to interactive maps. Currently Leaflet maps are the only mapping library supported, but the developer—<a href="https://github.com/kekscom" title="Jan Marsch's github profile">Jan Marsch</a>—hopes to also build in support for Google Maps and Nokia maps. At which point he plans to release the source on github: <a href="https://github.com/kekscom/osmbuildings/" title="kekscom/osmbuildings repo on github">kekscom/osmbuildings/</a></p>
