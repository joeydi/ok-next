<p>Well, I guess I can&#8217;t just leave well enough alone. I decided to re-design the site yet again, and I&#8217;ve still got a few tweaks to make here and there, but I was satisfied enough with it to post it up, so let me know what you think. One thing I wanted to accomplish with the new design was to have a &#8220;dashboard&#8221; style homepage instead of just the classic blog listing. I have been doing a lot more web design recently, and I wanted to showcase some of the projects I have been working on, as well as bits and pieces from across the site. Right now the homepage is just displaying one featured project, but I plan on building that out soon to include a few more projects, as well as recent posts, etc.</p>
