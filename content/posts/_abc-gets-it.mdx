<p>While attempting to watch one of ABC&#8217;s high-quality, full-screen videos available on their website, I was presented with <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/07/abc_install.jpg" title="ABC install dialog">this dialog.</a> Sure, I would have rather not installed another plugin, but they got it right. First, they explained what was going on in simple terms. Second, they referred to us as &#8220;Mac People&#8221;.</p>

<p>I wonder if the dialog for the Windows plugin is cold, ugly, and boring?</p>
