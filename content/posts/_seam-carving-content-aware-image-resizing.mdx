  <p>&#8220;Seam carving&#8221; allows an image to be resized non-uniformly, so you can change the height to width ratio in the image without cropping, but also without distorting important features in the image (such as faces).</p>

<object width="425" height="350">

    <param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param>

</object>

<p>This is so cool. With more publishing moving to the web, this seems like a great alternative to static images. It would allow you tool preserve the content of an image along with the integrity of a layout. I imagine it will be quite a while before we see a viable implementation of this technology.</p>

<p>On the other hand I can see simple uses of this concept that seem easy to implement. For example, if you had a portrait, and you wanted the image to be dynamically resized, but not scaled, you could set the pixel coordinate of the center of the face, and the browser would just center the face in the frame.</p>

<p>That coordinate information could be saved in an external file, so you would have portrait.jpg, and portrait.jgw, where .jgw is just a text file that contains the added info.</p>
