<p><a href="http://work.repponen.com/New-York-City-Guide">Really sharp cartography and interface design from Anton Repponen.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The city is a living organism; it breathes, eats, uses power, wakes up in the morning and sleeps during the night. The city can exist without attractions, shops, music halls and museums, but it cannot exist without the map. The map is the cityâ€™s heart. The first thing you do when you are new to a city is try to understand how its structured. Are the sights within walking distance of each other? What can I realistically see in 1 day? In 2 days? In 3 days? When you visit a city you automatically start thinking in time-based itineraries for the amount of time you will spend there.</p>
