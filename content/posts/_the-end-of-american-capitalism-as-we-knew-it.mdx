<p>Honestly some of this article is over my head, but this quote really validates how I&#8217;ve been feeling about all this shit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the reality of the modern, transactions-oriented model of financial capitalism indeed that large private firms make enormous private profits when the going is good and get bailed out and taken into temporary public ownership when the going gets bad, with the tax payer taking the risk and the losses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#8217;t see any profits, but we all get to share the losses. Yay for us! I hate what we&#8217;ve become.</p>
