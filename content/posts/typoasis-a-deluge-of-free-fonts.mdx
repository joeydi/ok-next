This website has a huge collection of fonts which are all free to download. I have downloaded a bunch and they all work great, and seem to have all the special characters included as well.

The only problem I have with this site is restraining myself from downloading hundreds of new fonts, which I will probably never use. Of particular interest to me was the [Blackletter Revival](http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm) collection. I started looking at these typefaces when I was designing our wedding invitations, and I think they are beautiful.

The entire collection is great, but I am particularly fond of [Jaecker-Schrift.](http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/htm/jaecker-schrift.htm) Check out this gorgeous [eth character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth) from that font.

[Go get yourself some new fonts](http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm) but don’t go crazy; you know you’ll never use them all.
