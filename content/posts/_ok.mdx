<p>Well after struggling to get an install of MySQL working properly (or rather an old version of MySQL, as apparently WordPress doesn’t like 4.1+) I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.mamp.info/" title="MAMP">MAMP</a> and I was up in a matter of minutes. If you are reading this it has probably been a few days at least, since I don’t have a static IP address yet &#8211; which makes it hard to really be out there. I hope to get this up and running full time, and really like the idea of maintaining my own server. I have an old iMac I am trying to get OS X installed on, so hopefully I will be able to port this all over there somehow. In the meantime I&#8217;ll be running intermittently on old faithful here.</p>
