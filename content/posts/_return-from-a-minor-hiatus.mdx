<p>A project I have been working on recently has taken up most of my time, and I&#8217;ve been so immersed in it that haven&#8217;t really taken the time to think about much else. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that interesting stuff stopped happening everywhere, everyday. So I&#8217;ve got a big list of links that I need to talk about.</p>

<p>Starting with this art project by Javan Ivey, a student a Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. It is a stop-motion animation with hand cut paper. Very tight animation for such a hands on piece. Check out how the artist modeled the concept first and created test animations to better envision what was capable and what the result should look like:</p>
