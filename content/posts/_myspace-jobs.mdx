<p>So I just realized that they have <a href="http://classifieds.myspace.com">classifieds &amp; job listings</a> on Myspace now.  My initial reaction was that Myspace was probably one of the worst possible forums for this type of service, and my instincts were quickly proven true as I scrolled through and found <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/08/myspace_jobs.jpg" title="myspace job listing">this listing</a><a href="http://../images/myspace_jobs.jpg">.</a><br/>
There&#8217;s two things wrong with this situation.  Do you really want potential employers to see all the crap you have up on your page: <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/08/juggle_guy.jpg" title="juggle guy">spring break photos</a>, <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/08/bacon_button.jpg" title="receive bacon">comments from your stupid friends</a>, <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/08/new_years.jpg" title="cheesy new years">drunken messages from ex-girlfriends</a>, etc.?<br/>
The other thing to think about is whether you want to work for someone they call &#8220;~~Queen Bitch~~&#8221;<br/>
Just something to think about.</p>
