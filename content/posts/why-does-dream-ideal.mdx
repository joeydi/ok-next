<p>Scott Simpson, of <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">YLNT</a> fame:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On <strong>my ideal date</strong>, a pretty lady laughs at my jokes over a delicious meal. We end the night by making passionate love. On <strong>my <em>dream</em> date</strong>, my 7th grade science teacher points and laughs at my teeth as they slowly crumble into the gravy boat. Our sommelier, Nick Nolte, brings us a bottle of live ants.</p>
