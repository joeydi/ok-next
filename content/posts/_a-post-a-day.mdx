<p>I figure if <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/">Ze Frank</a> can create an incredibly creative video blog every day for a year, I can write a god damned post once a day. I’m on a computer every day. And I mean <em>on</em> it. Like Hemingway on paper, on it. So even if I have to step away from my incredibly important, crucial to humanity, day-to-day grind, for 5 minutes to say “Yello?” to the world, well, so be it.</p>

<p>A post a day.</p>

<p>See you in a week 😉</p>

<p>quick poll: one or two spaces after a period?</p>
