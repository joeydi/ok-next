<p>A quick google search revealed that this is <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=161017">old news</a>, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.  My search also led me to this <a href="http://slumz.boxden.com/showthread.php?t=758853">awesome forum thread.</a> If you enjoy that enlightened discourse, check out <a href="http://slumz.boxden.com/showthread.php?t=758853">this video.</a></p>
