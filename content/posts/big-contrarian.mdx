<p>A beautiful, touching post about holding on to what is important, and letting the rest just fall away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a collector.  I love photographs.  I compulsively capture links to sites I visit, in case they might be lost forever.  I fill up my Instapaper account with articles I will never have the time to read.  The thought of clicking &#8220;Mark all as read&#8221; when I am deeply in debt to my RSS reader gives me anxiety.  What if I miss something?</p>

<p>So I click, I scroll, I link, I &#8220;like&#8221;.  I skim over an endless sea of other people&#8217;s lives, rarely diving deep enough to find the treasure.</p>

We stare into lenses and lie, if only a little, so that the record shows we were there, enjoying or not enjoying ourselves, in precisely the way weâ€™d prefer it.
