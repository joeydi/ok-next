<p>So today we had a little July 4th potluck at my work. Why not on Tuesday, you ask? Well, Fridays are &#8220;Shorts Friday&#8221; so they decided to do it today and up the ante to &#8220;T-Shirts &amp; Shorts Friday&#8221;, which makes sense because you just can&#8217;t have a July 4th party without seeing your boss in a really cheesy get-up. Unfortunately I was not able to get a picture of that, but I did capture this gem:</p>
