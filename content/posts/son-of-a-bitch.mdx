<p>Well, that was a pain in the ass. My IP address changed, but all the links in WordPress were set up using the old address. So getting back to the admin page was tricky&#8230; but do-able. I think the moral of the story is twofold &#8211; A: I need to break down and pay for hosting until I can afford to set up my own server and do it right. B: localhost, localhost, localhost. Until I get my shit in gear this set up is strictly for development purposes only.</p>

<p>Thanks, and goodnight.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, tomorrow is the start of a long birthday weekend for myself.</p>
