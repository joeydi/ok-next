<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting a new bike for a long time, and I finally indulged this afternoon. I have a Cannondale mountain bike, but the frame is too large for me (20&#8243;), and it has been slowing falling apart over the last year. I didn&#8217;t really want to spend the money to fix the derailleurs and the brakes, and replace the seat the was stolen (by worthless bastards). So I have been kicking around the idea of buying a new bike, but what I want is way out of my price range at the moment.</p>

<p>Today, I found this beauty on Craigslist for $100:</p>

<p>It is a mutt, but I love it. It has an Azonic 16&#8243; downhill/slalom frame and a Marzocchi fork. It also has an XT rear derailleur and disc brakes. Everything from the headset (FSA) to the cranks (Truvativ) is high quality, after-market stuff.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#8217;t have a front derailleur, which means I probably won&#8217;t be powering up South Mountain any time soon, but for tooling around town it is perfect &#8211; simple and fast. In a couple of weeks, we are moving to an apartment in Phoenix, which is just about 9 miles from my office. I am going to start biking to work after we move in, and I am going to give it a test run this weekend. Here is the route I plan to ride:</p>
