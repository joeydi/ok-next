<blockquote>
  <p>First and foremost, Inconsolata is a humanist sans design. I strove for the clarity and clean lines of Adrian Frutiger&#8217;s Avenir (the lowercase &#8220;a&#8221;, in particular, pays homage to this wonderful design), but also looked to Morris Fuller Benton&#8217;s Franklin Gothic family for guidance on some of my favorite glyphs, such as lowercase &#8220;g&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221;, and, most especially, the numerals.  Clearly a lot of thought and care went into the design of this monospace font.  If you are writing code or working in the terminal, try replacing your default with this one, which happens to be free.  I am using it at 14 point with ant-aliasing on, and it&#8217;s gorgeous.</p>
