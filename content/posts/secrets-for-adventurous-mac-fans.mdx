<p>Secrets is a new project from the creator of <a href="http://blacktree.com/?quicksilver">Quicksilver.</a>  It tracks hidden preferences in many Mac applications and provides an interface to them through a unified Preference Pane.</p>

<p>Some of these hidden preferences are no doubt hidden for a reason, but I&#8217;m sure there is few little things everyone would like to adjust. Take a look at <a href="http://secrets.textdriven.com/preferences/list">a list of all of the documented preferences</a> or <a href="http://blacktree-secrets.googlecode.com/files/Secrets_1.0.0.zip">download the software here.</a> But be warned: not for the faint of heart.</p>
