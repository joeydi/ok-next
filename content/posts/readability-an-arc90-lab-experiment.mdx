<p>Readability is a javascript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> that strips away all the clutter on a web page and just presents the main content in a nice, easy-to-read fashion.  When you visit the site to grab the bookmark, you can choose between a variety of styles with which to present web content when you are browsing.  It seems to work fairly reliably, although it works best on pages that are focused on one story or piece of content as opposed to a variety of content.</p>
