<p>Okay one more quick post for the night. I could go on, but I don&#8217;t want to use up all my good ideas&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is the first post in a series on all the cool apps I&#8217;ve found recently. I just got this one tonight, and I love it. Small, simple, free. In other words, perfect.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tice.de/software.php?page=Desky%20engl&amp;sprache=englisch">Desky</a> is a little app that changes your desktop picture. Its beauty lies in the fact that you only have to drag a picture onto the icon and it opens up, changes the background, and quits all in a matter of seconds. And with OS X&#8217;s ubiquitous drag-and-drop capabilities, you can do cool things like drag an image right off of a webpage onto the icon in the dock, and &#8220;voila!&#8221;, instant desktop glory.</p>
