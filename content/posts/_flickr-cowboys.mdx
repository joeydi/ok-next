<p>Last time I logged in to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> I was surprised to see <a href="http://../images/cowboys.jpg">these two cowboys</a> hanging out in my photos.  I don&#8217;t really know any cowboys&#8230; unless, of course, we&#8217;re talking about <a href="http://../images/spacecowboys.jpg">space cowboys</a>, in which case I know quite a few.<br/>
I guess it was just a database error that got those two guys in my thumbnails, but it threw me for quite a loop.  Anyways, stay tuned for cool photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeydi">my Flickr page.</a></p>
