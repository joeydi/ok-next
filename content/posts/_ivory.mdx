<p>Ivory is a German Spitz that made her way onto the Loop 202 freeway this morning during rush hour traffic. I watched her dash across six lanes of traffic, miraculously making it across unscathed. Nobody seemed to care that this dog was now stuck on the median and it was only a matter of time before it was killed. So I made my way across the highway and stopped a few yards ahead of her. She ran right up to me. I asked her what she was doing out on the highway, and since she didn&#8217;t have any good answers, I threw her in my truck and drove to work.</p>

<p>She had a tag on her collar, so I called the number linked to her license, and the lady who answered said she did not have any dogs. Phone numbers get re-used (which I think is retarded, but that&#8217;s another story) so it was possible that the owners had just not updated her license with their new number, and now someone else had the number. I tried again later to make sure, but it was the same lady.</p>

<p>At this point I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do, so I brought her home and got her some food. Later I took her to our vet, to have her scanned for an ID chip. Unfortunately she does not have one, but the vet wanted to call the number again, and I figured it couldn&#8217;t hurt. Whoever answered the phone that time identified the dog, and said she would come down to pick her up right away.</p>

<p>Weird. Maybe the lady I spoke with is a little senile. Or hates dogs. Who knows.</p>

<p>Anyways, I was thrilled to have tracked down her owner, and although I was very sad to let her go, I was glad to have resolved the whole situation.</p>

<p>I just called the vet, to make sure everything went smoothly with the pick-up, and it turns out they haven&#8217;t come yet. Supposedly they are going to pick her up tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m pissed. First, you let your dog get out and run around on the  highway. Then, you can&#8217;t even take the time to come get her when you find out she&#8217;s been rescued.</p>

<p>I was wrong. I must not have been pissed earlier, because <em>NOW</em> I&#8217;m pissed. The vet called me back and told me that the older lady (the one I talked to multiple times this morning, who insisted she did not have a dog) had called back and said that they weren&#8217;t going to be picking up the dog because they didn&#8217;t want it anymore.</p>

<p>Oh. That&#8217;s nice. So you decide to don&#8217;t want your adorable, loving, doe-eyed little doggie, and instead of taking it to a shelter like a human would, you just kick it to the curb like an ignorant piece of shit would.</p>

<p>Well, Ivory is spending the night at the vet&#8217;s office, who assured me that she is comfortable and has food and a chew toy. She will be coming back here in the morning.</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>Genevieve picked Ivory up from the vet this morning. Luckily, she was able to work from home today, so could bring Ivory to our apartment and take care of her.</p>

<p>She seemed to be a little more stable today. She was sniffing around, actually did some business, and even barked some. She was acting like a happy, healthy dog.</p>

<p>Around 2:30 this afternoon the &#8220;owner&#8221; showed up at the vet&#8217;s office. Long story shory: Ivory is their dog, so we had to return her. The fact that our intuitions told us not to let her near these people again doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

<p>I did speak with the guy who came to pick her up, and he was apologetic, thanked me for saving her, and assured me she would staying in a safe place. He also told me that he would get her license updated. Whatever.</p>

<p>I hope she is back with people that care about her and that she stays safe. That is all we can do at this point.</p>
