<blockquote><p><b><a href="http://pixelspread.com/chance/">The Infinite Monkey Generator</a></b> is a simulation of the infinite monkey theorem. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">infinite monkey theorem</a> states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. The generator allows the user to plug in a line of Shakespeare, or any word(s) they’d like, and watch as random strings of letters are generated. The application continues to generate a series of completely random letters until the user’s selected word has been stumbled upon, at which point the application will stop and let the user know the word has been found. Note: if you select a high speed it may slow down your machine. words longer than 4 letters long can take a very long time to generate randomly.</p></blockquote>

<p>My word, &#8220;okay&#8221;, took 347,679 characters before it was randomly generated in all its glory.</p>
