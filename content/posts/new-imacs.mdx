<p>Today Apple released upgrades to its <a href="http://log-a-rhythm.com/blog/../images/imac_24.jpg" title="The new lineup">line of iMac computers</a>, and unveiled a new member of the fam&#8217;, the 24&#8221; iMac.  The entire line now sports the Core 2 Duo processors as well.  Very nice.  I hope my cute little 20&#8221; can&#8217;t tell I&#8217;ve been coveting other rigs.</p>

<blockquote>The fastest iMac ever, the 24-inch iMac provides professional performance along with the convenience of an all-in-one design. Like its 17-inch and 20-inch siblings, it features the new 64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo processor with speeds ranging from 1.83GHz to 2.33GHz. The new processor delivers up to 50% more performance than the previous 20-inch iMac. It also doubles the amount of L2 cache, the twin cores sharing 4MB between them.</blockquote>
