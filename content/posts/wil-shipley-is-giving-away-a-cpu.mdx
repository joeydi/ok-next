<p>Thats right. The man behind <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> is giving away an Intel CPU for which he has no use.</p>

<p>&gt;The CPU is is supposed to be worth, like, $1,000, and it&#8217;s still sealed in its original box with a giant heat-sink and everything, and I&#8217;ve decided to give it away to some lucky blog reader.</p>

<p>Rather than have you perform some menial task, I&#8217;ve decided to combine my loves (attention-whore and the environment) and give the CPU to the greenest, gamingest reader out there.</p>
