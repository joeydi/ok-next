<p><a href="http://anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2832&amp;p=6">AnandTech</a> got their hands on a couple of pre-release engineering samples of Intel’s upcoming Cloverton chip, which sports four cores. Since they are pin-compatible with the current Xeon chip they said, “Hey how ‘bouts we drop these puppies in our fancy new Mac Pro.” OK. They probably didn’t say that, but the results are astonishing nonetheless:</p>

<blockquote>“all 8 cores were detected and functional.”</blockquote>
