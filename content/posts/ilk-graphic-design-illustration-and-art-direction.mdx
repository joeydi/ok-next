<p>This guy has <a href="http://ilkilkilk.com/">some great visual work</a> that you should check out. Everything from websites to graffiti. I like how the creative characters found in his graffiti carry over to his design work, as can be seen in this piece, titled &#8220;best wishes 2008&#8221;.</p>
