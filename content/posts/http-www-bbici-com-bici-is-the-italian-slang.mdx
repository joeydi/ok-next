<blockquote><i>Bici</i> is the italian slang for <em>bike/bikes</em>. Every Bertelli bicycle is a  unique design object that you won&#8217;t find in any store in New York City. Every <em>part</em> is assembled by hand, finished and fine-tuned by me, Francesco.</blockquote>

<p>These bikes are damn sexy.Â Go get yourself one.</p>
