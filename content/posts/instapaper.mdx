<p>This is a great little web utility that I think I will be getting a lot of use out of. Basically it is a bookmarking service, but it is super easy to set up and use. To sign up, all you need to do is provide a user name. You don&#8217;t even have to give them your email address. If you are scared that people might find your page and think you are weird for having bookmarked 23 pages regarding the migratory patterns of small rodents, then you can set a password, but that too is not required.</p>

<p>The magic happens with a little javascript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> that you drag to your bookmarks bar, and whenever you see a page that you want to save for later you just click on it and it adds it to your list, like so:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/120.png" alt="120" width="500" height="210"  className="alignnone size-full wp-image-3081"  srcSet="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/120.png 500w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/120-300x126.png 300w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/120-480x201.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

<p>What&#8217;s great is that, as opposed to actual bookmarks saved in your browser, you can access them from anywhere, and create them from anywhere. So say you are up late reading articles online and decide to call it a night, you can just add all of your tabs to Instapaper and finish reading them the next day at work. If, you know, you were into that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Instapaper is written and hosted by <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> and you can <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">get it here.</a></p>
