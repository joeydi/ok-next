<p>To the lady at Subway:  You only put two fucking tomatoes on my sandwich. If one of them falls off while you are wrapping it up, do you think you could put it back on the sandwich, instead of putting it in the trash. If tomatoes are so precious that you can only afford to give me two god-damned slices, shouldn&#8217;t you avoid wasting them?  Thank you, and have a nice day.</p>
