<p>Thumbtack is a website for finding and hiring local service providers. They recently featured Okay Plus in a &#8220;Thumbtack Spotlight&#8221; interview, called <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/spotlight/web-design-meister/" target="_blank">Web Design Meister</a>.</p>

<p>It was fun being interviewed about the origins of my business and my perspective on client services.</p>

<blockquote>If you want exceptional web design and development on par with much larger, more expensive agencies, along with very personal service that comes from working with a one-man shop, better try Joe di Stefano.</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s true! <a href="https://okaypl.us/contact/" title="Contact" target="_blank">Get in touch</a> to discuss your design or development project.</p>
