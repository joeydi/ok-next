<p>This is the first computer I ever had. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Plus">The Mac Plus.</a> What a sweet little machine. No hard drive. 1 MB of RAM. 8 Mhz processor. 512 x 342 pixels. Totally awesome. I&#8217;m going home in a couple of weeks and I&#8217;m going to fish this thing out of my mom&#8217;s attic. My girlfriend is going to give me that look, like &#8220;Are you fucking serious?&#8221; Absolutely.</p>

<p><em>Update: <a href="href=&quot;http://pcworld.com/article/id,126692/article.html" title="The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time&quot;">PC World</a> magazine just named the Mac Plus the 4th greatest computer of all time.</em></p>
