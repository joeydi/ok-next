<p>Gorgeous satellite photography of our amazing planet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The images you see below were taken at the turn of the Millennium, when NASAâ€™s scientists had a brilliant idea: to scan through 400,000 images taken by the Landsat 7 satellite and display only the most the most beautiful. A handful of the best were painstakingly chosen and then displayed at the Library of Congress in 2000.</p>
