  <p>Ever wanted to create your own isometric pixel picture, but didn&#8217;t know what the word isometric meant? Well, now you can fulfill your wildest dreams with Cubescape!</p>

<p>Good, pointless fun. <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/Cubescape/load.php?id=7007">See mine</a>, or <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/Cubescape/new.php">create your own</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I created a movie of <a href="/assets/img/blog/cubescape.mov">one of my designs animating</a>, and I also created an open Facebook group, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=44714795156&amp;ref=mf">&#8220;Cubescape Highlights&#8221;</a>, where people can share their creations. Go, cubes!</p>
