<p>Ok &#8211; so I figured out how to have my router assign my server the same local address from now on, so that should not be an issue. All ports are go. Well 8889 at least. I still have a dynamic address for my router, but it usually stays the same for at least a few weeks at a time, so I guess it should be suitable for now. Qwest does offer static IP addresses for residential accounts&#8230; $6.95 a month after a $25 set up fee. Pretty reasonable I suppose (in comparison to what, I don’t know) Nonetheless, I don’t feeling like forking out any cash right now. Or ever now that I think about it, though I have been known to make exceptions.</p>

<p>I figure keeping up with a dynamic IP address should keep me on my toes. That brings me to a general question I have for my audience. I know in reality I’m just talking to myself, but you never know. Couldn’t you set up some sort of bot that would ping your computer and request some sort of signature&#8230; then if your IP address changed, the bot would not locate the signature&#8230; which would cause it to alert you somehow. Or if the bot was inside your local network, then it could go back to your router and figure out the new IP address assigned to it. Then send you an email with that info. Then update everything that was referring to the old IP address. Then clean your house and make a batch of blueberry pancakes. Isn’t that possible? I know someone out there knows how to do this. I would even settle for just the first part. Or, I guess I could just pay the damn 7 bucks and be done with it.</p>
