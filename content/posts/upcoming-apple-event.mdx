<p>Apple has sent out invites to a press event, September 12 &#8211; just one short week away. <a href="http://log-a-rhythm.com/blog/../images/showtime_th.gif" title="It's Showtime">The invite</a> not so subtly evokes images of a movie premiere. I think full-length movies at the iTMS is a shoe-in, but I am rooting for a video streaming device. I think it is likely that the AirPort Express gets an upgrade, which would include video capability.</p>

<p>Even being the huge geek that I am, I can&#8217;t imagine watching an entire movie in front of my computer, no less hunched over my iPod. But I can imagine purchasing a movie online and streaming it to my home theatre. And considering that I haven&#8217;t returned a movie rental on time in my entire life, 15 bucks would be a screaming deal.</p>
