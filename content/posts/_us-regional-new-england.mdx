<p>I think I first saw Mark Weaver&#8217;s work in <a href="http://www.good.is/">Good magazine</a>.  I particularly like his collages with architectural imagery.</p>

<p>This infographic about New England really stood out to me though, I just wish I could see what he said about my home state, Vermont.</p>
