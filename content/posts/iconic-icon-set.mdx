Beyond offering raster and vector formats, they&#8217;ve also created a system dubbed &#8220;Smart SVGs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smarts SVGs are responsive, adjusting their level of detail depending on the size the are displayed at. Each icon is also composed of unique elements. You can target elements and groups of elements which share a property using CSS, allowing for some exciting customization opportunities.</p>

<p>While Iconic may not be suitable for every application, the technology is impressive, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing it in use in the wild.</p>
