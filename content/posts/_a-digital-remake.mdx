<blockquote>
  <p>The project is about a digital reconstruction of the traditional analogic process for drawing ‘illuminated natural letters,’ in the way Edward Johnston explained in 1906 in the twelveth section of his masterpiece, Writing &amp; Illuminating &amp; Lettering.  The artist, Andren Novali, used modern technology, namely Python and NodeBox, to recreate not just the appearance, but the process of creating traditional &#8216;illuminated letters&#8217;.  The results are beautiful.</p>
