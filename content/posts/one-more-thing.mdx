<p>A while a go I asked whether there was any utility to keep you updated on your current IP address, if you are stuck with a static IP.  Well it seems there are actually a few tools (mostly free) out there that do just that and more.  If you are in this predicament check out <a href="http://www.no-ip.com">www.no-ip.com</a> or <a href="http://www.dyndns.com">DynDNS.</a></p>
