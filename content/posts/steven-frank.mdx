<p>The release of the iPad is stirring mixed feelings in Steven Frank of <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic Software</a>.  In this article he tries to reconcile his understanding of the need for change in the pursuit of progress with his aging understanding of what computing should be.</p>

<p>I share his mixed feelings on the changing face of computing.  I own an iPhone and love the ease and simplicity of it, but I grew up tweaking applications with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit">ResEdit</a> until they broke.  I fear that by abstracting the machinery of computing away behind a shiny interface, people will eventually lose both the interest and the ability to use computers to their full potential.</p>

Personal computing — having a computer in your house (or your pocket) — as a whole is young. As we know it today, it’s less than a half-century old. It’s younger than TV, younger than radio, younger than cars and airplanes, younger than quite a few living people in fact. In that really incredibly short space of time we’ve gone from punchcards-and-printers to interactive terminals with command lines to window-and-mouse interfaces, each a paradigm shift unto themselves.
