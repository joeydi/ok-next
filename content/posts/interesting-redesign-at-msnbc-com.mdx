<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37643077">Pretty bold move for a mainstream new source, in my opinion.</a> First off, the entire article is one one page, as opposed to the multi-paging most news sites use to pump up page views. Big bold headlines, large line height for easy reading, tons of white space. Also, innovative navigation in the right margin, with the little icons that indicate where on the page different features reside.</p>
