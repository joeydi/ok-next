<p>Well, I&#8217;ve got that warm fuzzy feeling all over again. I have my site back up online after a short hiatus. I decided that running my own server, while interesting, was more than I could quite handle right now. And while I was able to get my local machine up and running on the <a href="http://dawnanddrew.podshow.com/">&#8220;inkernet&#8221;</a> I was concerned about security and bandwidth (assuming the forthcoming deluge of readers). So I broke down and got a hosting plan with <a href="http://mediatemple.com/">MediaTemple</a> and everything is going swimmingly. Seriously, these guys really seem to have their shit together and they are <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/site/credits/">fans of new media.</a></p>
