<p>Well it&#8217;s been a long time coming but I&#8217;ve finally moved this site over to Drupal. I had used Drupal to develop the Intranet at <a href="http://www.landiscor.com">my former employer</a> and really enjoyed the experience. Since then I have wanted to migrate my personal site, as I found Drupal easier to work with and much less daunting than WordPress. There are also infinitely more possibilities now that I am working with <a href="http://www.drupal.org">a real CMS.</a></p>

<p>I had definitely lost interest in blogging, and <a href="http://9ten11.com/okwp">my last redesign</a> didn&#8217;t turn out quite as I had imagined, in large part due to the fact that I just couldn&#8217;t wrangle WordPress with my limited knowledge of PHP.</p>

<p>I know that I like to tinker and design more than actually post interesting content, so maybe this is just another experiment. If so, well hey, that&#8217;s my prerogative. But I&#8217;m hoping that the new, light design, and the fact that I can actually manipulate the site without pulling all my hair out, will inspire me to spend a little more time here.</p>

<p>I do find it quite ironic that in one of my last posts I stated that I would do a post a day, and that was seven months ago. Maybe not ironic, just sad. Regardless, I think a post a day is probably unlikely for me. I&#8217;m going to start with a post a week. Actually, fuck it:  no expectations.</p>
