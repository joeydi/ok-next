<p>Well I am about to install Mac OS X 10.5, aka Leopard. I have heard some people have had troubles, but I&#8217;m ignoring most of that and forging ahead. Right now I am backing up all of my important files, just in case something were to go awry, and also because I should have been doing that all along. I did actually have a backup drive, but I did not have any system for performing the backups, so I would just copy folders to it as I saw fit, which was rarely. Ironically, that backup drive has failed, and I can&#8217;t even mount it, but thankfully my system is working just fine so its not really a problem. Now I have a 500 GB Maxtor OneTouch4 which I will primarily be using for Time Machine, but which is also housing this upgrade backup. Wish me luck.</p>
