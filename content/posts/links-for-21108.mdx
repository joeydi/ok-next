<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcwathieu/1041327312/in/set-72157601299541354/">Robotlab : bios bible (2007) on Flickr &#8211; Photo Sharing!</a><br />
Interesting. A robot writing the Bible. Check out the sweet font its capable of creating.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things &#8211; task management on the Mac</a><br />
Very sharp looking task management / <a href="http://gtd.43folders.com">GTD</a> software from Cultured Code. Still in beta. Just what I need: One more layer of technology to separate me from what I should actually be doing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid &#8211; Free Site Specific Browser for Mac OS X Leopard</a><br />
Fluid turns any website into a stand alone app on your Mac. So if you have a site that you constantly keep open, it can run in it&#8217;s own little world outside of your browser.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2008/02/07/the-evolution-of-tech-companies-logos/">Neatorama » Blog Archive » The Evolution of Tech Companies’ Logos</a><br />
Follow the evolution of popular logos over time. I think &#8220;Kwanon&#8221; should have stuck with the original.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.arillo.net/">aRILLO</a><br />
I dig the sharp vector style here. Interface could use some work though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/business/10metrics.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">Pushing Paper Out the Door &#8211; New York Times</a><br />
After filing a year and a half&#8217;s worth of documents last weekend, going paperless sounds awfully appealing. The $400 price tag on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ScanSnap-S510M-Instant-Sheet-Fed-Scanner/dp/B000WJCX18/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1202791827&amp;sr=8-2">Fujitsu ScanSnap</a> is, unfortunately, not quite as appealing.</p></li>
