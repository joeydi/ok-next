<blockquote>JSON Resume is a community driven open source initiative to create JSON-based standard for resumes.</blockquote>

<p>Being a web developer, I have an affinity for code, standards, schemas, etc., so I love the idea of an open standard for resumes. However, I don&#8217;t think this site is doing a great job of articulating it&#8217;s purpose. Even the tagline, &#8220;Resumes that developers love,&#8221; sells the concept pretty short, failing to appeal to a wide audience.</p>

<p>That said, I think there are many potential uses here. For instance, consulting businesses are often rushing to pull together proposals which include resumés for the players on the project. JSON Resume could help to bring those resumés together quickly, and output them to a common format that works with the proposal. There could even be a tool that allowed the user to pick and choose work experience which was most relevant to the project at hand.</p>
