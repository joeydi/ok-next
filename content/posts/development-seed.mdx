<p>Development Seed is a very interesting group of programmers and designers. They are a &#8220;communications&#8221; company, started in Peru, that focuses on working with grassroots organizations and others who are trying to change the world for good. Most of their work is based on the Drupal platform, and they seem to be really active in the Drupal community.</p>

<p>I found their site while I was searching for an SMS module for Drupal, and came across the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/smsframework">SMS Framework</a> project by Will White, one of their programmers. It is not quite ready for prime time, but I am really looking forward to its release. I have a project that would benefit greatly from the ability to automate SMS communication, and it would really add a &#8220;wow&#8221; factor to the website.</p>

<p>I would also like to integrate the module into this site in order to trigger events, and post messages from my cell phone.</p>
