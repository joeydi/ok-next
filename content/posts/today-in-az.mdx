<p>They recently launched their <a href="http://todayinaz.org/" title="Today In AZ">&#8220;Today In AZ&#8221;</a> campaign, which suggests small steps you can take every day to further their mission of quality education in Arizona. I had the opportunity to work on this project in conjunction with <a href="http://parkandco.com/" title="Park&#038;Co - Phoenix Advertising Agency">Park&amp;Co</a>.</p>

<p>The concept for the site was a yearly desk calendar, and we were able to bring the design to life using 3D animated page turns, and full screen background images that change to reflect the context and audience for each post. I leveraged the HTML5 History API to update the URL and maintain state between pages, while the animation provided a quick distraction as we load new content dynamically with AJAX.</p>
