<p>In a valiant attempt to suddenly become organized in regards to my time, and by extension my life, I have just set up, synchronized, updated, and published my future online. I know I&#8217;m a huge geek, but I really do think this could help me. As long as I don&#8217;t spend more time fiddling with different tools, feeds, protocols etc., than I do actually using the god-damn thing then I should be fine.
Really, I just set up three tools to talk to each other:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/" title="iCal">iCal.app</a></li>
<li><a href="http://google.com/calendar" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" title="37 Signals - Basecamp">Basecamp</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I use iCal to post all my personal events, Basecamp to keep track of work, and Google to access it all from anywhere. The only drawback to this set-up is that I can&#8217;t edit my iCal events from within Google Calendar (i.e. when I&#8217;m at work). I am publishing my iCal calendars to .Mac, but the web inteface for .Mac is horrible, only allowing you to view one calendar at a time without editing. Maybe eventually I will move my personal calendars to Google Calendar, but for now I like how iCal feels.</p>

<p>It seems like there should be a way to have all of my calendars in one central place, such as a folder on this webserver, which I could then link to from any calendar tool, whether it was an application, a web page, or a cell phone. The current situation only lets you &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to calendars, which means you can&#8217;t edit or save events in the central repository. We need two-way communication between all these different services.</p>

<p>Any ideas out there?</p>
