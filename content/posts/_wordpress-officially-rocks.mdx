<p>I am not sure why my opinion makes something &#8220;official&#8221; but it sounds good. My IP address did switch overnight, but it was very easy to update the site. I definitely need to get a static address before I forward to this site from a nice address like this one. But in the meantime everything is working great. I canâ€™t believe the number of plugins and themes available &#8211; I can see using WordPress as a framework for all kinds of sites.  Now to get some people over here&#8230;</p>
