<p>Another Drupal meetup in Phoenix; two months in a row! This time we are meeting on the ASU campus, and it should be quite interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chris Yates will be giving a presentation about the scientific and publishing applications he and his team are building with Drupal at the Mars Space Flight Facility at ASU.</p>
</blockquote>
