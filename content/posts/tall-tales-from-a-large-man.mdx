<p>I saw Aaron Draplin speak at ASU last night. It was a great talk; a great experience all around. I hadn&#8217;t been in Business Administration C since Econ 101 in &#8217;98. It was a familiar feeling sitting down in that lecture hall, but the presentation was all new. Aaron delivered fun, refreshing stories about design, living a passionate life, and being open to the opportunities that surround you.</p>
