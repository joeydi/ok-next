<p>Wow. It&#8217;s been such a long time since my last post  that I thought I&#8217;d drop a note to make sure this thing still worked. And if there are still any of you out there who follow this, well here&#8217;s a ding in your newsreader, but not much more.</p>

<p>But hold tight, there shall be more soon. I am currently (as of yesterday) in the middle of a move, but nevertheless, there will be a redesign shortly to integrate this blog with my portfolio site, and more great posts coming up, as there&#8217;s tons of cool stuff to write about.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I leave you with <a href="https://simple-creature-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/okayplus/uploads/2007/08/admin_skin.jpg" title="wp tiger admin screenshot">this</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/" title="wp tiger admin screenshot">wp tiger admin</a>, a WordPress plugin to give your admin page an desktop app look &amp; feel.</p>

<p>Groovy.</p>
