<p>Vermont has a burgeoning tech community, and there are plenty of exciting businesses that are currently hiring. However, our Green Mountain state still suffers from the perception that there are few jobs available.</p>

<p><a href="http://greatjobsinvermont.com/">The state recently launched a website</a> designed to &#8220;bring more awareness to Vermont-based companies and job openings,&#8221; according to Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin.</p>

<p>However, the site, as currently implemented, suffers from major technical shortfalls, and misses the mark on highlighting Vermont-based companies.</p>

<p><a href="http://digital.vpr.net/post/tech-workers-say-state-jobs-website-lacking">I was recently interviewed by Annie Russell of VPR on some of the issues with the site.</a></p>
