<p><a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a> is a web analytics service that I have really been wanting to try for a while but haven&#8217;t been able to bring myself to. Although I think the price tag ($30 per site) is very reasonable, I can&#8217;t quite justify spending money to find out that the only people who visited my site in the past month are my mother and my brother, and even then, only because I set my URL as their home page.</p>

<p>Regardless, Mint seems to be a great service, and I have heard nothing but <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2007/the-full-mint-y/">rave reviews of it.</a> <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/">Shaun Inman</a>, the man behind the cool, flavorful service, recently posted an image on Flickr describing the logic residing just beneath the surface of the Mint logo:</p>
