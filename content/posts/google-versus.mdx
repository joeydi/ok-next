<p>It&#8217;s good to see Gruber get back on his high horse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google fans seem to eat this kumbaya stuff up, to really believe it. But Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are now just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better. Think about even web search: Google search wasnâ€™t something new; it was something better. Way, way, way better, but still.</p>
