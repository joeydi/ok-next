<p>I am very excited to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.foodwhistleblower.org/" title="Food Integrity Campaign website">the new Food Integrity Campaign website</a>. I developed this site in conjunction with <a href="http://vernalcreative.com/" title="Creative and Strategy Services for Progressive Organizations">Vernal Creative</a>, based on designs by <a href="http://bensjohnson.com/" title="Art Director &#038; Designer">Ben S. Johnson</a>.</p>

<p>The Food Integrity Campaign is a branch of the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/" title="Protecting Whistleblowers since 1977">the Government Accountability Project</a>, which supports a community of whistleblowers, truth-tellers and advocates to safeguard our food.</p>

<p>This is an area I am very passionate about, and I&#8217;m proud to help this organization spread their message.</p>
