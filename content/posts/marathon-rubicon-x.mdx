<p>From <a href="http://www.macuser.com/games/marathon_is_back_again_for_fre.php">MacUser.com:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before Halo, Marathon was the hot game Bungie Studios made. It was even for Mac! The series was naturally very popular in our little community. I fondly remember the afternoons I spent playing it. Rubicon X is a completely new game, downloadable for free.</p>

<p>This is really cool. There are all new levels, etc., and the whole thing runs on the Aleph 1 engine which is open source, so&#8230; you know&#8230; nerd points. I remember getting a demo of Marathon at Macworld Expo Boston in &#8217;94. It definitely seemed ahead of its time, and it was great that it was for Mac.</p>

<p>Then Microsoft swallowed Bungie, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s free, so <a href="http://www.marathonrubicon.com/">go get it.</a></p>
