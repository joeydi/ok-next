<p>For what it’s worth, this gets my vote for top album of 2009.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They couldn’t think of something to say the day you burst
    With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
    They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
    Against the walls against your rules against your skin</p>
</blockquote>
