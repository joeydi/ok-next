<p>This past weekend I had the opportunity to speak to a local group of writers, artists, and small business people about the benefits of WordPress. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed sharing my knowledge with this passionate group from my community.</p>

<p>I was joined by <a href="http://www.troublesometots.com/about-alexis-dubief/">Alexis Dubief</a>, who gave <a href="http://www.alexisdubief.com/burlingtonwritersworkshop/">an excellent talk about &#8220;Being Awesome Online&#8221;</a>, which included practical advice for building your audience, and marketing yourself.</p>

<p><span>My presentation gave a high-level overview of the WordPress open-source Content Management System, and highlighted some of the differences between a self-hosted WordPress site and and the &#8220;freemium&#8221; service <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>.</span></p>
