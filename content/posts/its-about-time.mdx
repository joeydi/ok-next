<p>At first I thought this was a really clever concept for a clock:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/113.jpg" alt="113" width="385" height="289"  className="alignright size-full wp-image-3090"  srcSet="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/113.jpg 385w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/113-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>

<p>How often do you really need to know exactly what time it is? How often do you ask, &#8220;what minute is it?&#8221;  Those are the questions I asked when i first saw this clock, and the answer to both is, &#8220;rarely&#8221;? But the logic behind that line of questioning is flawed? Just because I rarely need to know exactly what time it is, doesn&#8217;t mean that at some point I won&#8217;t <em>really</em> need to know exactly what time it is?</p>

<p>The first time I looked up at this clock and wanted to know, for example, if I had two minutes to go to the bathroom before a meeting, and the clock didn&#8217;t have an answer, I would be extremely frustrated. Especially because a boring, regular, old clock would have been perfectly capable.</p>
