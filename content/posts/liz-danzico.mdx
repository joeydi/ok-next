<p>On the surface, riding the train in a loop sounds like the actions of a crazy person, but I think I get it.  It must be hard to work from home, and still have that sense of responsibility that comes from sitting in an office with a bunch of productive people.</p>

<p>I guess one way to add that back in, would be to get outside, sit amongst other members of the workforce, and maybe read the paper, as opposed to just shluffing over to the computer in your PJs.</p>

When I first left a full-time job to begin freelancing, for a brief time, I would run, shower, dress, and ride the train in a loop from my apartment and back again to begin work at home. Ritual is important.
