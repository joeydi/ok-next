<p>Hulu is a video website, similar to YouTube, but offering &#8220;premium content&#8221; such as full-length movies and primetime TV shows. It is a joint venture between FOX and NBC (funny they capitalize FOX, is it an acronym?  Maybe &#8220;Fucking obnOXious&#8221;) so I was quick to dismiss it as a misguided attempt by the old guard to move into this new space. But I am pleasantly surprised as the whole package seems really well put together and offers something you can&#8217;t really get anywhere else: a free, viable alternative to regular TV.</p>

<h2>Some Things They Got Right</h2>

<p>When grabbing the embed code, clicking on the Copy To Clipboard button generates a little checkmark to let you know that you are good to go. Smart.</p>

<p>Collections:  like playlists for videos. This will be <em>huge</em> once you can create your own.</p>

<p>Also, you can create your own clip by dragging the handles on the timeline. This is so clever&#8230; you can pick out your favorite scenes and share them. Here&#8217;s mine:</p>
