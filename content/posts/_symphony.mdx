<p>I have a crush and it’s on a web development framework. In fact, I think it’s more than a crush; I think I’m in love.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve used WordPress, Drupal, Frog CMS, and others to organize content and build websites for clients and myself. Symphony is the first one that made no assumptions about what I was trying to do, and just let me do things my way.</p>

<p>So excited about all the possibilities. If you need me I’ll be geeking out.</p>
