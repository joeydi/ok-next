<blockquote>
  <p>Cardon Copy, takes the vernacular of self-distributed fliers and tear-offs we have all seen in our neighborhoods. It involves hijacking these unconsidered fliers and redesigning them, over powering their message with a new visual language.  Both the concept and the execution of this project are excellent.  I especially like number 14, <a href="http://www.cardoncopy.com/fourteen/">No Parking</a> and number 18, <a href="http://www.cardoncopy.com/eighteen/">Watch Found</a>.</p>
