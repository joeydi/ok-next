<p><a href="http://www.macuser.com/software/a_look_at_computerworlds_15_th.php?lsrc=murss">MacUser</a> has a good run through of ComputerWorld&#8217;s <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9006104">&#8220;15 Things Apple Should Change in Mac OS X&#8221;.</a>  The only one I really have an issue with is #7: Inconsistent User Interface. Thats where <a href="http://gui.interacto.net/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1">UNO</a> comes into play. This great little utility changes all your windows to the <a href="http://okay-plus.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/uno.png">&#8220;unified&#8221;</a> look, which IMHO makes everything look much&#8230; awesomer.</p>
