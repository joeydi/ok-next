<p><a href="http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html">SafariStand</a> is an InputManager for Safari, which basically means that it is a back-alley plug-in. Apple&#8217;s web browser, Safari, does not have a supported plug-in architecture, which is a shame because that is the feature that I see as being the real draw of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox.</a> Regardless, I use Safari as I find it to be the fastest, slickest web browser on the market. Luckily, mac developers have another route for adding new functionality to Apple&#8217;s flagship browser through the use of InputManagers, such as the <a href="http://okay-plus.com/2008/01/inquisitor_ads">now infamous Inquisitor</a>.</p>

<p>I had stayed away from SafariStand in the past as it has a complicated install process, and <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/08430">some consider InputManagers to be something of a black art</a>. The new <a href="http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html">SafariStand</a> has some truly killer features though, and I was compelled to give it a try.
Among a host of features, there are two that stand out to me (admittedly a prototypical web geek) as must-haves:</p>

<h2>History Flow</h2>

<p>SafariStand saves a thumbnail of every page you visit, and then lets you browse them in a CoverFlow-like interface similar to that of iTunes. This is really best described visually:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/105.png" alt="105" width="500" height="366"  className="alignnone size-full wp-image-3103"  srcSet="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/105.png 500w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/105-300x219.png 300w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/105-480x351.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

<p>This is a really clever idea, and has been very helpful. It is much easier to recall what a page that you visited at a week ago looked like than it is to remember the title or address.</p>

<h2>Clip Web Archive</h2>

<p>This feature allows you to right-click on any element on a web page, and grab the source as a web archive. When you choose &#8220;Clip Web Archive&#8221; from the context-menu it reveals a powerful menu that lets you grab the HTML source of that element or any of its parent elements. For instance if you click on a paragraph you have the option of saving an archive of just that paragraph, or, for instance, the article that paragraph is within. See below:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/106.png" alt="106" width="500" height="235"  className="alignnone size-full wp-image-3104"  srcSet="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/106.png 500w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/106-300x141.png 300w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/106-480x225.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

<p>You also get the option to include a header in the archive that saves the page info and date recorded, as well as add a note. I have been using this to grab little pieces of info from around the web, and leave myself little notes about why I thought it was interesting. I find this to be much more powerful than just bookmarking an entire page.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/107.png" alt="107" width="500" height="387"  className="alignnone size-full wp-image-3105"  srcSet="https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/107.png 500w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/107-300x232.png 300w, https://okaypl.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/107-480x371.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

<p>I highly recommend installing SafariStand despite all the FUD surrounding InputManagers. Hey, if it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/history-flow">good enough for Jon Hicks</a>, it&#8217;s good enough for me.</p>
