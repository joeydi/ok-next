<p><a href="http://seansperte.com/">Sean Sperte</a> just a launched a new site for a conference at his church and I think he did an amazing job. Instead of rehashing my reaction to the design, here is my original comment from his post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fine work, Sean. I think you really nailed this one, and I believe it has a lot to do with organization. The navigation does not just feel like a way to split up the content, but rather a way to instantly get what you need.</p>
  
  <p>Granted, with the ease of use, everyone who visits the site will visit every “panel” at least once (probably more, simply to enjoy the animation) but you really get the feeling that all of the information is right there at your finger tips.</p>
  
  <p>Oddly, I like the “Register” button least of the entire design. I feel it’s a little kitschy and overbearing in the context of such a well laid out site. Also, although I’m sure you are not responsible for it, the result of pushing that massive button is certainly not a reward, at least on for the eyes.</p>
  
  <p>Congratulations on a job well done.</p>
